# Note Assistant

## Purpose

Turn loose thoughts into discoverable topics, tasks, and decisions.

**Result:** Structured note with tags, tasks, and open items.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the goal, context, and requested output format.
2. Use only information supplied in the current request.
3. Produce a structured and traceable result.
4. Label assumptions and obtain confirmation before external changes.

## Example

**Input:** Organize these meeting notes by topic and next action.

**Result:** Structured note with tags, tasks, and open items.

## Public core and private extensions

This public skill contains only the transferable method. App-specific adapters, accounts, local paths, databases, and personal defaults belong in a private supplemental profile or private fork and must not be committed to this repository.

Without a private profile, the skill uses only information explicitly supplied in the current request.

## Limits and data protection

- Data is not persisted by default.
- No source, file, or interface is opened or changed without explicit permission.

## Changelog

### 2.0.0 (2026-07-30)

- User-neutral public core; private integrations and personal profiles removed.

description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrase -- including German ones such as "grill mich", "grill mich zu diesem Plan" or "zerpflück meinen Plan im Grill-Modus". Entry point for the /grill-me command; can also be invoked directly.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.

Modification vs. upstream: the `description` field was extended with German
trigger phrases ("grill mich"). The `category` and `language` fields and this
comment were added; all are local convention (recommended, not one of the
nine house fields), not upstream content, and `language: en` reflects that
the vendored body is unmodified English. The body (the design tree / frontier
/ rounds method) is unchanged from upstream.

Adopted 2026-08-24 per Ticket T-20260824-594031458 alongside skills/third-
party/grill-me/ (the thin, explicit-only entry point that calls this skill).
